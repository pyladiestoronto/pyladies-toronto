Welcome to PyLadies Toronto!
============================

PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping women
become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our
mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through
outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

At PyLadies Toronto, we welcome people who have never programmed before,
experienced programmers, and everyone in between. We welcome all women,
including trans women, and non-binary folks. People of all genders are welcome to attend our meetups, 
but should respect that PyLadies Toronto is a place where women's voices are centered.
